Things you want to learn or try in class.

2. To also enhance my coding skills as I'm not the most confident when in comes to my skills in html, java and CSS
3. Learned how to use the command prompt to go through my files
-------------------------
Things that are unclear from last semester
1. How to use Github/Gitlab and using the terminal
2. Just a few things on how to make a website with HTML like grids and how to formate it/oganize a website.
